# Customer-Churn-Reduction-Using-Supply-Chain-Analytics
Company has seen a large drop in sales in the year 2018 after succeeding in previous 3 years due to increase in customer churn. Company needs to reduce customer churn by understanding the reasons for loss of shipment orders.We have observed that the majority of orders were delivered late.so in this project we are taking ‘Late_delivery_risk’ column as target which is a categorical column with 0 and 1 where if the order is delivered late (1) and (0) if the order is delivered on time. We would be using the Supervised Learning –Classification to predict late delivery risk. The company can use this information to make sure that they deliver the product on time and decrease customer dissatisfaction due to late delivery.
